## Deb Sankar Banerjee

Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Physics](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/) in Carnegie Mellon University working with Prof. [Shiladitya Banerjee](https://shiladitya-banerjee.com/). My primary research interests lie in understanding the physical principles which drive the complex and rich dynamics seen in **living active matter systems**. My current research activities are mainly focused on studying the formation and size regulation of intracellular structures (e.g., filaments, networks, organelles, condensates etc) and studying the collective dynamics and self-organization of active elements (e.g., growing filaments, contractile actomyosin network, cell junction etc) seen across the scales from sub-cellular cytoskeleton to supra-cellular structures and tissues. I employ various analytical and computational methods ranging from coarse grained active hydrodynamic description to stochastic reaction network and microscopic molecular dynamics simulations, to model and
study biological systems

## My Research

### Cytoskeletal dynamics across scales:
I apply concepts from cell biology, mechanobiology and soft-condensed matter physics to un-
derstand how local actomyosin forces are organized and orchestrated from sub-cellular to supra-cellular
scales to create complex (tissue) shape and dynamics.

*Possible mechanisms for the movement of actomyosin-dense structures in an active affine elastomer: a moving deformation of the actomyosin mesh without turnover, implying a traveling front, and b moving deformation of the actomyosin mesh with differential myosin binding unbind rates at the leading and trailing edges of the front*
