## Deb Sankar Banerjee

Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Physics](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/) in Carnegie Mellon University working with Prof. [Shiladitya Banerjee](https://shiladitya-banerjee.com/). My primary research interests lie in understanding the physical principles which drive the complex and rich dynamics seen in living active matter systems. My current research activities are mainly focused on studying the formation and size regulation of intracellular structures (e.g., filaments, networks, organelles, condensates etc) and studying the collective dynamics and self-organization of active elements (e.g., growing filaments, contractile actomyosin network, cell junction etc) seen across the scales from sub-cellular cytoskeleton to supra-cellular structures and tissues. I employ various analytical and computational methods ranging from coarse grained active hydrodynamic description to stochastic reaction network and microscopic molecular dynamics simulations, to model and
study biological systems

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/DebsankarBanerjee/DebsankarBanerjee.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
