Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [James Franck Institute](https://jamesfranckinstitute.uchicago.edu/) at The University of Chicago working with Prof. [Suri Vaikuntanathan](https://vaikuntanathan-group.uchicago.edu/). My primary research interests lie in understanding the physical principles that drive the complex and rich dynamics seen in **living matter systems**. My current research activities are mainly focused on understanding how physical learning leads to mechanochemical adaptation at a cellular or tissue level, studying the formation and size regulation of intracellular structures (e.g., filaments, networks, organelles, condensates etc), and studying the collective dynamics and self-organization of active elements (e.g., growing filaments, contractile actomyosin network, cell junction etc) seen across the scales from the sub-cellular cytoskeleton to supra-cellular structures and tissues. I employ various analytical and computational methods ranging from coarse-grained active hydrodynamic description to stochastic reaction network and microscopic molecular dynamics simulations, to model and
study biological systems.

## My Research

### Cytoskeletal dynamics across scales:
I apply concepts from **cell biology**, **mechanobiology** and **soft-condensed matter physics** to understand how local actomyosin forces are organized and orchestrated from sub-cellular to supra-cellular scales to create complex (tissue) shapes and dynamics. The broader goal of my research in this direction is to understand the dynamics of the elementary organizations of the actomyosin machinery (e.g., subcellular cortex, cellular junction etc) and to uncover the cross-talk between such organizations that drive the **tissue remodelling**.

### Self-organization of intracellular structures:
I combine ideas from statistical mechanics, cell biology and systems biology to study the design principles employed in dynamic self-organization and size-regulation of various organelles and intracellular structures. I have used chemical master equations and stochastic reaction networks and hydrodynamics to describe the problems of self-organization.

### Physical learning in biological systems:
Traditionally, learning has been studied in neuroscience to understand how the assembly of neurons and modifications of synaptic transmission between them (i.e., synaptic plasticity) facilitates learning in the brain. On the other
hand, learning in physical systems is an emerging field of study in material science and engineering, where physical systems, without neurons, can adapt their interactions autonomously based on local responses in the
presence of a stimulus to acquire functionality or a desired response. Living matter systems are dynamically self-organized with non-equilibrium forces and continual turnover of their components, and my studies aim to understand how such remodelling processes and active forces influence (facilitate or suppress) physical learning in the context of cytoskeletal dynamics and tissue morphogenesis.
